### Project 3 - Problems vs. Algorithms

1. Floor of the square root in O(logn) time
1. Search a rotated sorted array in O(logn) time
1. Rearrange integer array elements to produce two numbers with the maximized sum, for example: for input [4, 6, 2, 5, 9, 8], output (852, 964)
1. Dutch National Flag problem
