## Problem 7 - Http Router using a Trie

The time complexity for insert and find are O(m) where m is the number of elements in the path. This could be
considered constant as it is not related to the overall size of trie itself.

The space complexity is relative to the number of path elements stored in the trie, so O(n) where n is the number of path elements stored
