## Problem 1 - Floor of the Square Root of an Integer

The floor value of the square root of integer n is another integer between 0 and n. 
A binary search should yield the number in O(logn) time complexity 

The algorithm is purely a recursive computation - no data structure is used. The space complexity is therefore constant O(1)
