## Problem 4 - Autocomplete with Tries

The time complexity for insert and find are O(m) where m is the length of the inserted word or search term. This could be
considered constant as it is not related to the overall size of trie itself.

The space complexity is relative to the number of characters stored in the trie, so O(n) where n is the number of characters stored
